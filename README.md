# Histomap Generator
This is intended generate histomaps similar to [John B. Sparks 1931 piece, titled “The Histomap: Four Thousand Years of World History.”](https://www.worldhistorycharts.com/the-histomap-by-john-sparks/)  

I was inspired by [this post](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/23659/is-there-a-way-to-procedurally-generate-the-history-of-a-world) asking how to procedurally generate a world history and represent it in the form of the histomap.

To simulate an early history I interpret [Peter Turchin's model for Cycling in the Complexity of Early Societies](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5536t55r#page-1)
